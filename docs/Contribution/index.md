# Contribution Guidelines

This document details how you can contribute to this project in simple steps.

## Steps to Contribute

1. **Setup the Environment (Do Once).**  
    Ensure you have setup your environment correctly. Click [here](/docs/Contribution/EnvSetup.md) if you haven't.

2. **Create a new branch from the assigned issue:**  
    You will create a new branch for the specific task you are to perform.  
    - Go to the Issues page and Open the issue you are to work on.
    - On the side section, look for `Development`. Click on `create a branch`. This will give you a pop-up.
    - Give the branch name. We prefer you start it with your name and followed by a short name for the branch that represents the work you are doing. e.g. `abdullah/hooks/useColor`, `hasan/comp/Button`, etc.
    - Ensure that the branch source is `main` and you select `checkout locally`. Then click on `Create branch`.
    - Run the displayed code within the terminal on your local repository. Usually, the code should be:  
        ```
        git fetch origin
        git checkout <your-branch-name>
        ```  
        For example, if you want to work on the branch: `hasan/comp/Button`.  
        ```
        git fetch origin
        git checkout hasan/comp/Button
        ```  
    - You can always use the code below to see the list of the branches on your workspace and to know the active branch:
        ```
        git branch
        ```  
3. Stage your work  
    Perform the tasks assigned to you.
    - Check the state of your work
        ```
        git status
        ```
    - Once you are done with a chunk of work, you should add the changes that you wish to commit using:
        ```
        git add <file-name>
        ```
        For example, if I wish to add changes in `src/shared/components/Button.tsx` file, I will use:
        ```
        git add src/shared/components/Button.tsx
        ```
        Or if you wish to add all the files, you will use:
        ```
        git add .
        ```
        Take note of the fullstop.
    - This only adds the changes to the staging area.
4. Commit and push your work:
    Once you are done with your work and you have added it to the staging environment, you should commit and push your work.
    - To commit
        ```
        git commit -m <message>
        ```
        For example:
        ```
        git commit -m "[EDIT]: Adding new button variant."
        ```
    - To push:
        ```
        git push
        ```
    This only makes your work available on the repository. But it has not merged it into the main branch.
5. Create a pull request to the main branch  
    The active development of the entire team is maintained on the main branch. Once your task is done, you need to create a pull request.  
    - Go to the `Pull Request` section on the GitHub page.
    - Click on `New Pull Request`.
    - Click on the branch you wish to create pull request for. This will then show you all your changes.
    - Then click on `Create new pull request`.
    - Thereafter, you await the reviews and approval. If there is any request for reviews, you just need to perform steps 3 and 4 again to make necessary corrections. 
    - Note: You are not required to open a new pull request if the previous pull request has not been merged yet. However, if it has been merged already, you will need to create a new pull request for the new changes.
